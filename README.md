For the past few months, I have been extremely interested in the work being done in the Design for Emerging and Nanoscale Manufacturing at UC Berkeley. Computed Axial Lithography (CAL) is an innovative 3D printing technique that leverages computed tomography (CT) principles to produce high-resolution, complex objects in a fraction of the time required by traditional additive manufacturing methods.

At its core, CAL is a volumetric additive manufacturing process that uses light to solidify photosensitive resin into a desired shape. Unlike traditional layer-by-layer 3D printing methods, CAL creates entire volumes simultaneously by exploiting the physics of light projection and polymerization. The process draws inspiration from CT imaging, where a series of 2D X-ray images taken at various angles around an object are reconstructed computationally into a 3D model. CAL reverses this principle: instead of reconstructing an object from projections, it deconstructs a digital 3D model into a series of 2D projections, which are then projected onto a vat of photosensitive resin. When these light patterns intersect within the resin, they cumulatively deliver sufficient energy to trigger polymerization and solidify the material into the desired 3D shape.

The operational mechanics of CAL can be broken down into several key steps. First, the desired object is converted into a digital 3D model. This model is then mathematically decomposed into a series of 2D cross-sectional images, which represent the object from different rotational perspectives. Algorithms calculate the precise light patterns needed to achieve the desired energy deposition within the resin. Next, a dynamic light source, such as a digital micromirror device (DMD), projects these 2D images onto the vat of resin. The light patterns rotate around the resin, ensuring uniform exposure. The photosensitive resin contains photoinitiators that react to light of specific wavelengths. When the cumulative light energy at a point within the resin exceeds a threshold, polymerization occurs, and the material solidifies. Areas receiving less energy remain liquid and can be drained away post-process. Finally, after the projection phase, the vat contains the solidified object surrounded by unpolymerized resin. The unpolymerized resin is drained, and the solid object is washed, cured further if needed, and removed. This simultaneous volumetric approach bypasses the need for support structures and allows for the creation of geometries that would be challenging or impossible with traditional 3D printing techniques.

CAL introduces several significant advantages over traditional additive manufacturing techniques. Since CAL forms entire objects volumetrically, it drastically reduces printing times. While layer-based techniques can take hours or days to build a complex object, CAL can produce comparable parts in minutes. Additionally, CAL enables the fabrication of highly intricate geometries without the constraints of layer-by-layer assembly. This capability is particularly beneficial for objects with internal cavities, overhangs, or detailed lattice structures. Furthermore, CAL creates objects with isotropic properties, meaning their strength and durability are consistent in all directions, unlike traditional 3D printing, which often results in anisotropic mechanical properties due to the layering process. CAL also does not require support structures, simplifying the post-processing workflow and reducing material waste. Finally, the volumetric nature of CAL makes it more scalable than traditional methods. Multiple objects can be printed simultaneously within the same resin vat, provided they fit within the projection volume.

I think CAL holds immense promise, but issues must be addressed before its widespread adoption. The range of available photosensitive resins is currently limited. Developing resins with broader mechanical, thermal, and optical properties is critical for expanding CAL’s applications. The resolution of CAL-printed objects depends on the light projection system's precision and the resin's photopolymerization kinetics. Accurately controlling the energy threshold for polymerization across the entire volume is another complex challenge. Uneven energy distribution can lead to defects or incomplete curing. Finally, the specialized hardware required for CAL, including high-precision light projection systems, can be expensive, posing a barrier to entry for smaller organizations.

The unique capabilities of CAL position it as a transformative technology in various industries. For instance, in the medical and biotech fields, CAL’s ability to produce complex, patient-specific geometries makes it ideal for creating prosthetics and implants. The technology can also fabricate scaffolds with intricate pore structures, supporting cell growth for regenerative medicine. In aerospace and automotive sectors, CAL’s precision enables the creation of lightweight lattice structures that maintain strength while reducing weight. Engineers can quickly iterate designs, accelerating development cycles. In consumer goods, the ability to produce personalized, ergonomic designs makes CAL suitable for wearables like hearing aids and eyewear. High-resolution printing capabilities can also be used for intricate designs in jewelry and decorative items. In research and education, CAL provides researchers with a tool to create complex models for studying fluid dynamics, material properties, or biological systems. The speed and precision of CAL allow for the rapid creation of teaching aids and prototypes. In electronics, CAL’s ability to fabricate fine details can support the creation of microfluidic devices for diagnostics or lab-on-a-chip technologies. It can also produce custom enclosures for electronic components, ensuring precise fits and protection.

As the technology matures, several advancements could further enhance CAL’s capabilities. Expanding the library of compatible resins, including those with conductive, magnetic, or biocompatible properties, will open new application domains. Hybrid systems combining CAL with traditional methods could leverage the strengths of both approaches, such as using CAL for intricate components and conventional 3D printing for bulk structures. Applying machine learning to optimize projection patterns and energy distribution could improve precision and reduce defects. Developing smaller-scale CAL systems could enable applications in microfabrication, such as the production of MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems). Advances in hardware design and manufacturing techniques could lower equipment costs, making CAL accessible to a broader range of users.

Computed Axial Lithography represents a paradigm shift in additive manufacturing, combining speed, precision, and complexity in a way that traditional methods cannot match. While challenges remain, the potential applications in medicine, aerospace, consumer goods, and beyond underscore its transformative impact. As research and development continue, CAL is poised to become a cornerstone technology in the future of manufacturing.
